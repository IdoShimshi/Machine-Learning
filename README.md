# Machine-Learning
A repository for Machine Learning course at BGU

In this course we will survey diverse practical and
successful methods, which can be implemented efficiently and simply, even with
very large input sizes. We will understand the mathematical reasoning behind these
methods, and apply them in practice on data from real problems. The following
topics will be covered:
- Learning methods for automatic classification of objects to categories, such
as SVM, kernels, decision trees, random forests and nearest neighbor and Neural Networks.
- Condensed representation of big data using dimensionality reduction, such
as PCA.
- Clustering methods such as k-means and spectral clustering
- Model fitting methods such as Gaussian mixtures, maximum likelihood, and
EM.
